# 8. in2out_ed

## 8.1. Introduction
NAT44 endpoint-dependent inside to outside network translation.

There are 6 nodes:
* nat44_ed_in2out_node
* nat44_ed_in2out_output_node
* nat44_ed_in2out_slowpath_node
* nat44_ed_in2out_output_slowpath_node
* nat44_ed_in2out_reass_node
* nat44_ed_in2out_reass_output_node

NAT44 endpoint dependent mode enables endpoint dependent filtering and mapping for all sessions needed by some features. Some existing functionality such as service load balancing, twice nat, out2in-only static mappings, unknown protocol dynamic translations and forwarding feature with dynamic translations are now available only in endpoint dependent mode. Endpoint dependent mode use 6-tuple (source IP address, source port, target IP address, target port, protocol, FIB table index) session hash table key instead of 4-tuple (source IP address, source port, protocol, FIB table index).

## 8.2. Detail
NAT44 supports multiple threads, the packets with the same 6-tuple only goes to the same thread, and tranlate port ranges are assigned to different threads.

### 8.2.1. snat_main_per_thread_data_t
This is per thread data.
```
typedef struct
{
  /* Main lookup tables */
  clib_bihash_8_8_t out2in;
  clib_bihash_8_8_t in2out;

  /* Endpoint dependent sessions lookup tables */

```
#### 8.2.1.1. in2out_ed
This is endpoint dependent sessions lookup tables, and it's VPP classic Bounded-index extensible hash.

* Key is source address, destination address, protocol, fib index, source port and destination port.
* Value is session index.

#### 8.2.1.2. user_hash
Find-a-user => src address lookup.
* Key is source address and fib index.
* Value is user index.

#### 8.2.1.3. list_pool
This is LRU list for session. 

It's array, we can use index to locate array element.

And it contains multiple doubly-linked list, each user has one doubly-linked list, we can use head, next and prev pointer to locate list element.
* Value is session index.

#### 8.2.1.4. users
user_hash table is used to manage users.
```

  u32 nstaticsessions;
} snat_user_t;
```
* sessions_per_user_list_head_index is the head index of doubly-linked list for this user.
* nsessions is sesssion number for this user.
* nstaticsessions is static session number for this user.

#### 8.2.1.5. sessions
in2out_ed table and doubly-linked list are used to manage sessions.
```
typedef CLIB_PACKED(struct
