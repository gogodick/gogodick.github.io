# 1. feat_bitmap
bitmap for managing feature invocation.

## 1.1. Introduction
This is drop node for feature bitmaps.
For features that just do a drop, or are not yet implemented. Initial feature dispatch nodes don't need to set b0->error in case of a possible drop because that will be done here. The next node is always error-drop.
