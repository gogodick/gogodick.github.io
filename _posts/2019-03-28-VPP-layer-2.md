# 1. feat_bitmap
Bitmap for managing feature invocation.

## 1.1. Introduction
This is drop node for feature bitmaps.

For features that just do a drop, or are not yet implemented. Initial feature dispatch nodes don't need to set b0->error in case of a possible drop because that will be done here. The next node is always error-drop.

## 1.2. Interface
Initial function is feat_bitmap_drop_init().

# 2. l2_api
Layer 2 forwarding api

## 2.1. Introduction
This module is not a node, and this module provides external L2 API.

## 2.2. Interface
Support below L2 API:
```
#define foreach_vpe_api_msg                                 \
_(L2_XCONNECT_DUMP, l2_xconnect_dump)                       \
_(L2_FIB_CLEAR_TABLE, l2_fib_clear_table)                   \
_(L2_FIB_TABLE_DUMP, l2_fib_table_dump)                     \
_(L2FIB_FLUSH_ALL, l2fib_flush_all)                         \
_(L2FIB_FLUSH_INT, l2fib_flush_int)                         \
_(L2FIB_FLUSH_BD, l2fib_flush_bd)                           \
_(L2FIB_ADD_DEL, l2fib_add_del)                             \
_(WANT_L2_MACS_EVENTS, want_l2_macs_events)		    \
_(L2_FLAGS, l2_flags)                                       \
_(SW_INTERFACE_SET_L2_XCONNECT, sw_interface_set_l2_xconnect)   \
_(SW_INTERFACE_SET_L2_BRIDGE, sw_interface_set_l2_bridge)       \
_(L2_PATCH_ADD_DEL, l2_patch_add_del)				\
_(L2_INTERFACE_EFP_FILTER, l2_interface_efp_filter)             \
_(BD_IP_MAC_ADD_DEL, bd_ip_mac_add_del)                         \
_(BD_IP_MAC_FLUSH, bd_ip_mac_flush)                             \
_(BD_IP_MAC_DUMP, bd_ip_mac_dump)				\
_(BRIDGE_DOMAIN_ADD_DEL, bridge_domain_add_del)                 \
_(BRIDGE_DOMAIN_DUMP, bridge_domain_dump)                       \
_(BRIDGE_FLAGS, bridge_flags)                                   \
_(L2_INTERFACE_VLAN_TAG_REWRITE, l2_interface_vlan_tag_rewrite) \
_(L2_INTERFACE_PBB_TAG_REWRITE, l2_interface_pbb_tag_rewrite)   \
_(BRIDGE_DOMAIN_SET_MAC_AGE, bridge_domain_set_mac_age)         \
_(SW_INTERFACE_SET_VPATH, sw_interface_set_vpath)               \
_(BVI_CREATE, bvi_create)                                       \
_(BVI_DELETE, bvi_delete)
```

Initial function is l2_api_hookup(), and this function is used to add vpe's API message handlers to the table.

# 3. l2_bd
layer 2 bridge domain.

## 3.1. Introduction
This module is not a node, and this module is used to manages Layer 2 bridge domains.

## 3.2. Interface
Initial function is l2bd_init(), and this function creates a dummy bd with bd_id of 0 and bd_index of 0 with feature set to packet drop only. Thus, packets received from any L2 interface with uninitialized bd_index of 0 can be dropped safely.

## 3.3. Command
```
set bridge-domain learn <bridge-domain-id> [disable]
```
```
set bridge-domain forward <bridge-domain-id> [disable]
```
```
set bridge-domain flood <bridge-domain-id> [disable]
```
```
set bridge-domain uu-flood <bridge-domain-id> [disable]
```
```
set bridge-domain mac-age <bridge-domain-id> <mins>
```
```
set bridge-domain arp term <bridge-domain-id> [disable]
```
```
set bridge-domain arp entry <bridge-domain-id> [<ip-addr> <mac-addr> [del] | del-all]
```
```
show bridge-domain [bridge-domain-id [detail|int|arp|bd-tag]]
```
```
create bridge-domain <bridge-domain-id>
                 [learn <0|1>] [forward <0|1>] [uu-flood <0|1>] [flood <0|1>] [arp-term <0|1>]
                 [mac-age <nn>] [bd-tag <tag>] [del]
```
## 3.4. Detail
* Why need hash map for bd_id -> bd_index?

The bd_index is from bitmap, and allocate db_configs dynamically, consume less memory.

* Mac age processing.

Please refer to bd_set_mac_age().

If there's at least one bd need mac age, use signal event to notify l2fib_mac_age_scanner_process_node to start mac age processing.

If there's no bd need mac age, notify l2fib_mac_age_scanner_process_node to stop mac age processing.

vlib_process_signal_event_data() must be used in main thread.

# 4. l2_bvi_node
Layer 2 Bridged Virtual Interface.

## 4.1. Introduction
This module is not a node, and this module provides bvi_device_class interface to send packets to l2-input.

# 5. l2_bvi
Layer 2 Bridged Virtual Interface.

## 5.1. Introduction
This module is not a node, and this module defines bvi_device_class and provides related commands.

## 5.2. Command
```
bvi create [mac <mac-addr>] [instance <instance>]
```
```
bvi delete <interface>
```
# 6. l2_efp_filter
Layer 2 egress EFP Filter processing.

## 6.1. Introduction
It is possible to transmit a packet out a subinterface with VLAN tags that are not compatible with that subinterface. In other words, if that packet arrived on the output port, it would not be classified as coming from the output subinterface. This can happen in various ways: through misconfiguration, by putting subinterfaces with different VLAN encaps in the same bridge-domain, etc. The EFP Filter Check detects such packets and drops them. It consists of two checks, one that verifies the packet prior to output VLAN tag rewrite and one that verifies the packet after VLAN tag rewrite.

## 6.2. Interface
Initial function is l2_efp_filter_init().

## 6.3. Command
```
set interface l2 efp-filter <interface> [disable]
```

# 7. l2_fib
Layer 2 forwarding table (aka mac table).

## 7.1. Introduction
The MAC Address forwarding table for bridge-domains is called the l2fib. Entries are added automatically as part of mac learning, but MAC Addresses entries can also be added manually.

This module uses l2fib_mac_age_scanner_process() to scan mac table for aging.

## 7.2. Interface
VNET_SW_INTERFACE_ADMIN_UP_DOWN_FUNCTION, if interface is down, need to flush mac.

Initial function is l2fib_init(), and this function creates the hash table.

## 7.3. Command
```
show l2fib [all] | [bd_id <nn> | bd_index <nn>] [learn | add] | [raw]
```
```
clear l2fib
```
```
l2fib add <mac> <bridge-domain-id> filter | <intf> [static | bvi]
```
```
test l2fib [add|del|check] mac <base-addr> count <nn>
```
```
l2fib del <mac> <bridge-domain-id> []
```
```
l2fib flush-mac all
```
```
l2fib flush-mac interface <if-name>
```
```
l2fib flush-mac bridge-domain <bd-id>
```
## 7.4. Detail
l2fib uses bihash (bounded-index extensible hashing) for MAC table. 

Bihash support multi-thread add/del operation, and it does not require reader locking.

Static MAC can't be aged or flushed.
### 7.4.1. Data structure
MAC table is at l2fib_main_t.
```
typedef struct
{

  /* hash table */
  BVT (clib_bihash) mac_table;

  /* per swif vector of sequence number for interface based flush of MACs */
  u8 *swif_seq_num;

  /* last event or ager scan duration */
  f64 evt_scan_duration;
  f64 age_scan_duration;

  /* delay between event scans, default to 100 msec */
  f64 event_scan_delay;

  /* max macs in event message, default to 100 entries */
  u32 max_macs_in_event;

  /* convenience variables */
  vlib_main_t *vlib_main;
  vnet_main_t *vnet_main;
} l2fib_main_t;
```
If client_pid is configured, this node will send MAC event to registered client.
```
typedef struct
{

  /* Hash table */
  BVT (clib_bihash) * mac_table;

  /* number of dynamically learned mac entries */
  u32 global_learn_count;

  /* maximum number of dynamically learned mac entries */
  u32 global_learn_limit;

  /* client waiting for L2 MAC events for learned and aged MACs */
  u32 client_pid;
  u32 client_index;

  /* Next nodes for each feature */
  u32 feat_next_node_index[32];

  /* convenience variables */
  vlib_main_t *vlib_main;
  vnet_main_t *vnet_main;
} l2learn_main_t;
```
MAC entry flags are:
```
/**
 * Flags associated with an L2 Fib Entry
 *   - static mac, no MAC move
 *   - not subject to age
 *   - mac is for a bridged virtual interface
 *   - drop packets to/from this mac
 *   - MAC learned to be sent in L2 MAC event
 *   -MAC learned is a MAC move
 */
#define foreach_l2fib_entry_result_attr       \
  _(STATIC,  0, "static")                     \
  _(AGE_NOT, 1, "age-not")                    \
  _(BVI,     2, "bvi")                        \
  _(FILTER,  3, "filter")                     \
  _(LRN_EVT, 4, "learn-event")                \
  _(LRN_MOV, 5, "learn-move")
```
### 7.4.2. Function
* l2fib_mac_age_scanner_process()

  The loop waits for timeout and event, and it uses l2fib_scan() to iterate MAC table for MAC aging and MAC event.
  + L2_MAC_AGE_PROCESS_EVENT_START, configure bridge domain and flush mac will trigger this event. This event will also start timer.
  + L2_MAC_AGE_PROCESS_EVENT_STOP, configure bridge domain will trigger this event. This event will also stop timer.
  + L2_MAC_AGE_PROCESS_EVENT_ONE_PASS, flush mac will trigger this event. 
  + When client_pid is configured and timeout, this case is only used for MAC event.

* l2fib_scan()
  + MAC aging. This function uses clib_bihash_add_del to remove aged entry.
  + MAC event. Send MAC event to registered client, including MAC_EVENT_ACTION_MOVE, MAC_EVENT_ACTION_ADD and MAC_EVENT_ACTION_DELETE.
